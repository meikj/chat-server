Chat Server

This project is intended for educational purposes. The main reason for the
development of this software is to further my understanding of networking.
At the moment the software uses WinSock, but I have plans to incorporate
BSD/POSIX sockets for future Linux compatibility. This project is presently
far from complete. No production value intended.
